## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Install the package tinytex into your system using the following commented command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages('tinytex') 
#tinytex::install_tinytex() 

#if you need to uninstall TinyTeX, run tinytex::uninstall_tinytex()
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Tinytex, is needed for creating pdf reports via R-markdown.

## Q1. Task with YAML Header (A)

-   Edit the YAML header / metadata to reflect your name.

## Q2. Task with Markdown Formula

-   During Monday's class, we learned that the sum of squared deviations from mean for a given set of data SS is given by $$SS = \sum_{i=1}^N (\bar{X} - x_i)^2$$

-   Knowing this above definition of SS (in latex formatting), similarly, produce the full formula for variance below? Make sure it is in Bold. (Hint: Variance when we are working with a population = $SS/N$, and Variance of a sample is $SS/N-1$)

$$
\mathbf{SS/N = \sum_{i=1}^N (\bar{X} - x_i)^2/N}
$$

## Q3. Task with Rcode and chunks (functions)

Below is a function that computes sum of squares, and two defined vectors

```{r}
compute_SS <- function(x) {
  n <- length(x)
  mean_x <- mean(x)
  sum_squared_diff <- sum((x - mean_x)^2)
  return(sum_squared_diff)
}

# These vectors are a sample from a population.
vector_a <- c(5, 5, 5, 5, 5)
vector_b <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
```
